				<h1>Bio</h1>

				<p>Video Void is what happens when French Disco and retrofuturistic Pop collide.

				</p> 


				<p id="bio2002p">Back in 2002, a 13 year-old Prince fan heard the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYxmyWaxd_Y">"Palladium"</a>, by Alan Braxe and Fred Falke
				on the French radio late at night. </p>

					<p id="pimgbio1">Feeling that he stumbled onto something special, equally emotional and powerful,
					he decided he would spend the coming years creating electronic music ;
					fusing the poppier, warmer, more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpQ6NtbZxiE">soulful vibes</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCP1m2ly_r0">old school Disco</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiuSRQHLv88">Funk</a> with the heavier, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rYiRqmZS-8">housier</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jvrX5PpPpw"> more synthetic sounds of late 90's</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJANEEjBOQI">early 00's French Touch</a>. Around this time, his older brother made 
					him listen to some Reggae tracks he had made using <a href="https://fr.audiofanzine.com/groove-machine/yamaha/QY70/avis/">a little sequencer</a> ;
					it made him realize he could use inexpensive technology to turn his numerous musical ideas into reality.

					<p id="pimgbio2">For the subsequent years, he listened avidly to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJgdTwHCtXc">80's Pop</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TP_2imoUac"> Italo Disco</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKLXkb5op2A">Soul</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ksJjkWeSew">Funk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JROAUa8Z7Mo">Electro</a>, digesting every bit of music he came in contact with. During his teens, he experimented with making music on a computer, on a 4 track cassette recorder, and playing live with his friends in a band he had formed.
					
					He spent time producing many genres of music, figuring out what he liked and what he didn't like. In 2014, he released his critically acclaimed 1st EP <a href="https://soundcloud.com/videovoid/sets/early-traxx-ep">"Early Traxx"</a> on Future City Records.
					As the name would suggest, it's a compilation of some early dance-oriented tracks : they're mostly influenced by Italo Disco, even though <a href="https://soundcloud.com/videovoid/video-void-early-traxx-02-love-in-a-major-m05">"Love in A Major"</a> has a similar feel and production style to that of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmLYHkqLc0s">French Touch heroes</a>.</p>

				<p>4 EP's (amongst them one with psychedelic side project <a href="https://videovoid.bandcamp.com/album/automaticity">Plastic Clich√©s</a>), <a href="https://www.videovoidmusic.com/discography#Singles">2 singles</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/videovoid/sets/remixes">more than half a dozen remixes</a> later, the man behind Video Void still longs to quench his numerous musical obsessions.</p>


				<p>The drive to break new musical grounds, to explore different genres of music, fusing the old with the new,
				and to take listeners on memorable journeys never left him. 
				No one can accurately predict where his music will go next, but one thing is certain :</p>

				<p id="funride">it sure will be a fun ride.</p>
